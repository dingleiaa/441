						<h3>Who We Are</h3>
						<img src="images/t.png" title="name" alt="">
						<h4>We have reformed the teaching building</h4>
						<p>The university teaching building is the main place for students to learn and teachers to teach, and is an important component of the campus. This teaching building has a solemn and grand appearance, adopting a classic architectural style, showcasing a strong academic atmosphere and cultural heritage.



							The internal facilities of the teaching building are complete and the layout is reasonable. The floor height is moderate, with sufficient lighting, providing a comfortable learning and working environment for students and teachers. Each classroom is equipped with advanced multimedia equipment and intelligent teaching systems, facilitating interactive teaching and autonomous learning for teachers and students.
							
							
							
							In addition, the teaching building also emphasizes humanized design and services. There are multiple lounges, discussion rooms, and self-study areas in the building for students to freely communicate and learn. At the same time, the management team of the teaching building provides 24-hour services to ensure that the learning and living needs of teachers and students are met.
							
							
							
							In short, university teaching buildings are important places for students to learn and teachers to teach. They not only provide high-quality teaching resources and learning environments, but also serve as a cradle for cultivating students' comprehensive qualities and innovative abilities.</p>
